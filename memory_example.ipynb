       "     {'content': \"France, as a distinct entity, has a long history that evolved over centuries. The origins of modern France can be traced back to the division of the Carolingian Empire. The Treaty of Verdun in 843 AD is often cited as a significant event, as it divided the empire among Charlemagne's grandsons. This treaty led to the formation of West Francia, which roughly corresponds to the territory of modern France.\\n\\nOver time, West Francia evolved through various dynastic changes, territorial expansions, and political developments to become the Kingdom of France. The Capetian dynasty, beginning with Hugh Capet's coronation in 987 AD, played a crucial role in consolidating power and laying the foundation for the modern French state.\\n\\nFrance continued to develop through the Middle Ages, the Renaissance, and into the modern era, with significant events such as the French Revolution in 1789, which transformed it from a monarchy into a republic. Each of these periods contributed to the formation of the nation we recognize today as France.\",\n",
